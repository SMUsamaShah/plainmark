# Plainmark

Chrome extension to save URLs (+title +notes) to various plain text targets (local makdown file, Workflowy, Dynalist, Gist). 

My main goals were:
- Easy bookmarking with a note. Selected text while bookmarking becomes its note.   
  I think that all tools that allow bookmarking a thing (github stars for example) should also have a note. Lots of time when I go back to github stars, twitter saves, steam wishlists, I forget what made me save that.
- Plain text.  
  List of saved links should not need a software.

What it is not meant to do:
- Browsing bookmarks
- Folders (use notes, may be add your own hashtag as a note e.g. #game, #invention and then search for that where your bookarks are going)

Made this to work with Dynalist originally where I could dump any interesting URLs with a note. Could also share interesting links, app urls etc from my android phone too using HTTP Request Shortcuts

## Usage

- Click the extension icon in toolbar
- Right-click → "Save page" on page or a link, or selected text. Selected text becomes 
- A popup in upper right corner will appear to add/edit the note on that bookmark. Can also delete the bookmark from that popup.

## Bookmark targets

- Local markdown file
- Dynalist
- Workflowy
- Github Gist

## Install

1. Clone or download this repo
2. Go to `chrome://extensions` → enable Developer mode → Load unpacked → select this folder
3. Open the extension options, pick an endpoint, fill in any required settings

# Future Ideas, maybe

- When writing note in the box, typing # should show an autocomplete list of predefined hashtags. This is to allow easier searching. But search should not depend on tags probably
  (may be)
- Show all bookmarks on the options page.
  (Not sure if it should be done at all, bookmarks are mostly a url dump)
- Categories.
  (Probably a bad idea, this will become increasingly complex based on target endpoint. Markdown needs headings and putting a link under that heading. Dynalist/workflowy will require specifying each node ID for that category. Yeah bad idea)
